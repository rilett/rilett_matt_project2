			<h3>About Us</h3>
			<p>In the spring of 1986 the TRAA was formed by anglers concerned with the state of the fishery in the Thames River watershed, particularly the dwindling smallmouth bass population in the North Thames River.</p>
			<p>The TRAA is not a fishing club, although most members are anglers and share fishing as a common interest. We are a "hands on" environmental group who likes to work at a grass roots level.</p>
			<p>The TRAA is a volunteer organization, governed by a formal constitution and by-laws. An elected Executive, with the guidence of the General Membership, sets the policies and direction for the TRAA.</p>

			<p>The TRAA has a history of always having a core group of active members supported by those who just want to be part of the solution. Either way, every member of the TRAA is active in their advocacy for the health of the Thames River watershed and its inhbitants.</p>

			<h3>The TRAA Works at a Grassroots Level Within the Thames River Watershed to:</h3>
				<p>Protect, enhance and regenerate a viable, multi-species, year-round fishery.
				 and participate in environmental clean-up, pollution control and rehabilitation.
				Breed, relocate and stock to re-establish or augment appropriate species of fish.
				promote environmentally sound sport fishing practices.</p>
				<p>Form partnerships with community businesses, government agencies, special interest groups, landowners, and other stakeholders in the Thames River watershed.
				increase public awareness of the unique diversity of the Thames River Watershed, its challenges, its recreational opportunities and its vital importance to our community</p>
				<p>"Hands-on Environmentalism" is what we do ...
				This is what sets the TRAA apart from other clubs and organizations. You'll find us right in the water clearing obstructions from streams, measuring returning salmonids and taking scale samples for DNA analysis, education through trout hatchery tours and stream walks, being a voice for the Thames River watershed and its inhabitants and the list goes on.</p>

		<h3>Rainbow trout</h3>
		<img src="images/caught_fish.jpg" alt="rainbow trout" width="200" height="200">
		<p>The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is a trout and species of salmonid native to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific Ocean in Asia and North America. The steelhead (sometimes called "steelhead trout") is an anadromous (sea-run) form of the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) or Columbia River redband trout (O. m. gairdneri) that usually returns to fresh water to spawn after living two to three years in the ocean.</p>
		<img src="images/eggs.jpg" alt="rainbow trout eggs" width="200" height="200">
		<p>Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout average between 1 and 5 lb (0.5 and 2.3 kg), while lake-dwelling and anadromous forms may reach 20 lb (9 kg). Coloration varies widely based on subspecies, forms and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by a broad reddish stripe along the lateral line, from gills to the tail, which is most vivid in breeding males.</p>
		<img src="images/caught_fish2.jpg" alt="measuring fish" width="200" height="200">
		<p>The scientific name of the rainbow trout is Oncorhynchus Mykiss. The species was originally named by German naturalist and taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 based on type specimens from the Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia. Walbaum's original species name, mykiss, was derived from the local Kamchatkan name used for the fish, mykizha. The name of the genus is from the Greek onkos ("hook") and rynchos ("nose"), in reference to the hooked jaws of males in the mating season (the "kype").
